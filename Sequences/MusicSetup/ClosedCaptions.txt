[Charlie Brown]: I guess you were right Linus
I shouldn't have picked this little tree
Everything I do turns into a disaster
I guess I really don’t know what Christmas is all about
Isn’t there anyone who knows what Christmas is all about!


[Linus]: Sure Charlie Brown,
I can tell you what Christmas is all about...
Lights please...

[Dwight Shrute]: Enough of this garbage!
This is Christmas!

{NOW PLAYING: Deck the Halls by Richard Campbell}

Yeaasss!

[Jeremy Morris]: I am the only American,
probably the only person in the world,
who has been banned in a federal court,	
from decorating for Christmas.

[Audio Engineer]: Uh hold up
Uh just hold up for a second
[Snoop Dogg]: Wait hold up?
Man I sound awesome right now
What are you talking about?

[Audio Engineer]: Nah it’s not... 
it’s not you,
it’s a tech thing.
So, just you go ahead and take five. 

[Snoop Dogg]: The way I sound in my ear drums, 
this is immaculate man.

[Sam the Snowman]: 
You know Dasher 
and Dancer 
and Prancer 
and Vixen
Comet 
and Cupid 
and Donner 
and Blitzen
But do you recall
The most famous reindeer of all?

{NOW PLAYING: Rudolph the Red-Nosed Raindeer by Goldfinger}

Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
Had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it
You would even say it glows
All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games
Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say
"Rudolph, with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?"
Then how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee
"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
You'll go down in history"

Or ya thirsty for more?

{NOW PLAYING: Wish Liszt (Toy Shop Madness) by Trans-Siberian Orchestra}
