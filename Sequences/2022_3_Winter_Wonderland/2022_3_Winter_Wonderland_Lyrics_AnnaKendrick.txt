Here comes Santa Claus
here comes Santa Claus
Right down Santa Claus Lane
Vixen
Blitzen
all his reindeer
Pulling on the reins

Here comes Santa Claus
Here comes Santa Claus
Bells are ringing
children singing
All is merry and bright
Hang your stockings
and say your prayers
Cause Santa Claus comes tonight  

Here comes Santa Claus
Here comes Santa Claus
Here comes Santa Claus
Santa Claus comes tonight 
Santa Claus comes tonight
