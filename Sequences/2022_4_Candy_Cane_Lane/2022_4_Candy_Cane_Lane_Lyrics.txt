What's this?
This is the north pole
no it's not
yes it is
no it's not
yes it is
no it isn't  
yes it is
no it isn't  
yes it is
no it's not
where's the snow?

Take a trip down Candy Cane Lane with me
It's so magical, let's go there in your dreams
It's the best, 
so get dressed, 
I'll impress
You with the lights in all their windows
Red and yellow and pink and green
Orange and purple and blue
Christmas is waiting for you
Christmas is waiting for you
Red and yellow and pink and green
Orange and purple and blue
Christmas is waiting for you
Christmas is waiting for you
Candy Cane Lane, 
bring a friend this holiday
Bring a friend who loves to play, 
we'll eat all the candy canes
Oh, Candy Cane Lane, 
bring a friend this holiday
Bring a friend who loves to play, 
we'll eat all the candy canes
Candy canes
We'll eat candy canes
