Good evening and welcome to the 
Fisher Family Light Show!

As a reminder,
please turn off your headlights,
and ensure you're not blocking any driveways. 
Please keep your volume at a reasonable level,
and remember to be respectful of our wonderful neighbors.

Now, sit back, relax, and enjoy the show.
